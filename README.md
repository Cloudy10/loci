This is an implementation of the **LOCI** (local correlation integral) fast outlier detection algorithm in Python, based on the paper:  
Papadimitriou, S., Kitagawa, H., Gibbons, P.B. and Faloutsos, C., 2003, March. *Loci: Fast outlier detection using the local correlation integral*. In Data Engineering, 2003. Proceedings. 19th International Conference on (pp. 315-326). IEEE.

This is an initial first attempt implementation, it is functional (I think) however performance is very limited.

##### Dependencies

- Scipy, Numpy
- Python version 3.6 (probably works with 3.x, not tested though)
